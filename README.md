Answering the question of how life came to be, cooperativly.

I am as of now a student of computer science. A few years back I had the idea simulate very beginnings of life, disussed the idea with some friends and here we are.

# Requirements
Most of the files will eiter be .txt, .md or .pdf. For the latter files to read your run-of-the-mill PDF-reader will do, for the former I recommend NotePad++ or MarkText.
